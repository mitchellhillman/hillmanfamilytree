His father was born in Machester, Michigan, on June 13, 1863 and his mother in Osborn, Ohio, on May 1, 1870. His paternal grandparents were Francis Diane and Josephine L. Heard, Francis Duane being born in Avon Springs, New York, on February 8, 1834, and Josephine in Coulterville, Illinois that same year. His grandparents on his mother’s side were both from Ohio. John Erb Miller was born August 22, 1833 and Mary Jane McNabb Miller on July 5, 1840.\n\nDuring the First World War, Francis was an aviation cadet. However, before his training was completed, the war was over and he was discharged. Upon his discharge in 1918 he came to Washington, D.C.\n\nAbout two years later, when he was 24 years old, he began his lifelong career with Standard Oil Company (now known as Exxon.) He worked on oil tankers, beginning as a merchant seaman. As the years passed, he rose in rank to first mate and eventually captain. He retired in 1957, at the age of 63.\n\nIn 1929, Francis was living in the New York City metropolitan area. It was here that he married Elizabeth Kranauer on September 1, 1929. The daughter of Joseph J. (Jr.) and Emma Stucki Kranauer, Elizabeth was born in Morges, Switzerland, on November 4, 1906. When she was two years old she immigrated to America with her parents, who settled in Washington, D.C.\n\nGrowing up in Washington, Elizabeth received her education in the public schools there. In 1925 she graduated from McKinley Technical High School in the northeastern section of the city.\n\nAfter their marriage, Francis and Elizabeth remained in New York, where they had two children, Richard, born July 9, 1930, and Sylvia Yvonne, born December 1, 1932. It was around this time that Elizabeth contracted tuberculosis; several times while her children were growing up she had to be hospitalized because of the disease.\n\nIn 1938, Francis and his family returned to Washington, D.C.\n\nWhen World War II began, Francis’ experience with Standard Oil prepared him well for service with the U.S. Navy. During this war he was the captain of a naval oil tanker in the South Pacific. By the war’s end, he had attained the rank of commander.\n\nIn 1955, Francis and Elizabeth left Washington, moving to the more healthful climate of Saranac Lake, New York.\n\nAs a youth Elizabeth attended Concordia Lutheran Church; in her later years she became quite active in the Methodist Church. Francis was a Quaker, but was not actively involved with any church.\n\nFrancis enjoyed helping out with organizations of which he was a member–the American Red Cross, the Humane Society, and Alcoholics Anonymous. Elizabeth, too, was a Red. Ross volunteer, and also helped in the Meals on Wheels program.\n\nFrancis died on January 9, 1981, at Saranac Lake, New York. He was 83 years old. His cause of death was cancer of the bladder, possibly the result of a life-long habit of smoking. His son states, “During my father’s employed life he was on the move much of the time. Only after retirement was I able to spend time visiting with him.”\n\nTwo years later, in June 1983, at Saranac Lake, Elizabeth suffered a fatal heart attack. She was 76 years old. Her son recalls, “I lived with my mother until age 21 except for two occasions when she was hospitalized with TB. We were close all my life up to one or two weeks before he death.” When asked what gave his mother particular pleasure in life, he responded, \\I think seeing her children doing well.”–Richard Hillman, respondent"},

Hillman who was energetic, enthusiastic, and artistic, began a series of seed illustrations, working out the distinguishing botanical characteristics and devising means of identifying them under moderate magnification. His drawings were technically perfect and beautiful. Upon publication of Eperiment Bulletin No. 24 in 1900, entitled “Clover Seed and their Impurities” by Hillman.
